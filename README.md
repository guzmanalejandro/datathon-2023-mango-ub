# UPC Datathon 2023 - Fashionub
# About our project
## Inspiration
Our journey began at a datathon, where the challenge of fusing fashion with technology captured our imagination. Among various challenges, this one stood out as the most intriguing. We were inspired to simplify the daily dilemma of outfit selection, combining our passion for engineering with the art of style.

## What it does
Fashionub acts as a digital stylist, using advanced algorithms to recommend complete outfit combinations. It analyzes current fashion trends and personal preferences, offering users a personalized fashion experience at their fingertips.

## How we built it
Fashionub was meticulously crafted by our team during a datathon, backed by a comprehensive dataset provided by Mango. This dataset was pivotal, enabling us to experiment with various machine learning algorithms. After rigorous testing and analysis, we selected the algorithm that delivered the highest accuracy and best performance. Our approach combined this algorithm with a user-friendly interface, focusing on transforming complex data into simple, actionable fashion advice.

## Challenges we ran into
Our main challenge was ensuring a balance between technical precision and user-centric design. Creating algorithms that not only follow fashion trends but also cater to individual tastes was a complex yet rewarding task.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are most proud of developing an app that resonates with users, helping them confidently choose their daily outfits. Witnessing the practical impact of our algorithms in real-life fashion choices has been incredibly fulfilling.

## What we learned
This project enhanced our skills in various domains, from machine learning and UI design to understanding fashion's dynamic nature. It also underscored the value of teamwork, adaptability, and responding to user feedback.

## What's next for Fashionub
Looking ahead, we plan to enrich Fashionub with social media integration for style sharing, expand our style database for greater diversity, and create an AI-driven personal shopping assistant to further elevate the user experience.
